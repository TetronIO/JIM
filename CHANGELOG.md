# Changelog

All notable changes to JIM (Junctional Identity Manager) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- 🔒 Every response from JIM now carries defence-in-depth security headers, including a Content Security Policy, clickjacking denial, and MIME-sniffing protection.
- 🔒 Every NuGet dependency, including transitive packages, is now locked to exact known-good versions, making JIM's builds reproducible and tamper-evident from source through to container image.

### Added

- ✨ The REST API is now protected by configurable rate limiting: per-client request limits with sensible defaults, tunable from Service Settings without a restart, returning standard 429 responses with Retry-After guidance.
- ✨ RFC references in a Connected System's schema attribute descriptions (for example "RFC2256: business category" on an LDAP Connector) are now hyperlinks to the corresponding page on the IETF Datatracker, so you can jump straight to the defining specification.

### Changed

- 🔄 The JIM PowerShell module now returns output objects with PascalCase property names (`$obj.DisplayName`, `$obj.Type.Name`), following PowerShell convention, instead of the REST API's camelCase wire casing. PowerShell member access is case-insensitive, so most scripts are unaffected, but `Get-Member`, `ConvertTo-Json` and `Format-Table` now surface PascalCase; scripts that compare property-name strings or round-trip output through JSON may need updating. Dictionaries keyed by your own data (a Metaverse Object's Attributes, a log entry's Properties) keep their keys exactly as supplied.
- 🔄 Exports now default to a conservative connector-recommended degree of parallelism when a Connected System's Max Export Parallelism isn't explicitly configured, instead of always defaulting to sequential. The LDAP Connector recommends two parallel batch pipelines for capable directories (those tuned to a high Export Concurrency) and stays sequential otherwise. An explicitly configured Max Export Parallelism value is always respected.

### Fixed

- 🐛 Deprovisioning a group member no longer destroys the group's other pending exports: a group with an unexported Delete Pending Export keeps it (deprovisioning supersedes membership updates; previously the Delete was silently replaced by a membership-removal Update, leaving the group alive in the target system forever), and a group provisioned but not yet exported keeps its Create Pending Export (previously it was silently deleted, stranding the group unprovisioned).
- 🐛 Membership removals staged when deleting Metaverse Objects now appear on the synchronisation run's Activity: each staged Pending Export is reported with its referencing group's name and counted into the run's totals (previously these exports were only written to the log, so an Activity could stage thousands of removals while reporting zero Pending Exports).
- 🐛 Large exports with many reference-bearing objects (for example thousands of groups) no longer fail partway with "the connection pool has been exhausted". Each parallel export batch previously pinned a database connection for the remainder of the run, draining the pool after around 29 batches; batch resources are now released as each batch completes.
- 🐛 The activity progress shown while an export works through its deferred reference phase is now accurate. It previously restarted the processed count from zero against the full run total (for example "2,884 of 209,984"), producing a misleadingly low objects-per-second rate and a wildly inflated time-remaining estimate.
- 🐛 Exports running with Max Export Parallelism above one no longer send unresolved reference values (raw internal identifiers) to the target system. Reference resolution results are now persisted before parallel export batches execute, so every batch sees the resolved values; previously group memberships could be exported as invalid values and fail (for example "invalid per syntax" from an LDAP directory).
- 🐛 Synchronisation runs whose only outcomes were out-of-scope disconnections (for example a leaver cohort passing a relative-date scope boundary) no longer show an empty Outcomes cell in the Operations history and Activity list; new chips display out-of-scope disconnections and out-of-scope retained joins alongside the existing outcome chips.
- 🐛 Closing the browser or navigating away while an admin page with tabs (such as Operations) was open no longer records spurious Error-level "Navigation failed" and "Unhandled exception in circuit" entries in the JIM.Web log. Any remaining browser-disconnect noise from the framework is now logged at Warning, so Error entries once again indicate genuine problems.

### Performance

- ⚡ Deleting Metaverse Objects that groups reference (for example a leaver cohort) is now dramatically faster. Staging the groups' membership-removal Pending Exports previously reloaded the Synchronisation Rules and every referencing group's full membership on each page of deletions, costing over 80 seconds per page against large groups; it now works set-based from the pre-deletion capture and a targeted database query, sized by the number of deletions rather than group size. A 2,000-user leaver cohort at 200,000 objects with 10,000 groups that took over 9 hours to synchronise is projected to complete in well under an hour. Recall staging also no longer piggybacks unrelated drift corrections onto membership-removal exports; drift correction remains the job of drift detection.
- ⚡ Exports no longer stall between batches at large scale. Batch collection now walks the Pending Export queue in a single pass (keyset pagination, backed by a new index) instead of rescanning it from the start for every batch; at 200,000 objects with 10,000 reference-bearing groups the old behaviour spent hours re-reading already-collected rows before the first group reached the target system.
- ⚡ The tail of a large, reference-heavy export no longer spends time paging through Pending Exports it has already identified as deferred. Once a batch turns out to be entirely reference-bearing, JIM now collects the remaining deferred exports in a single query instead of continuing to page through them 100 at a time.
- ⚡ Full Imports at large scale are dramatically faster: matched objects are no longer hydrated one database round trip at a time, confirming a large group no longer degrades quadratically with its membership size, and bulk attribute value writes now stream via PostgreSQL binary COPY instead of parameterised inserts. A Full Import of 210,000 objects that previously took over 40 minutes now completes in around 8.
- ⚡ Deprovisioning users who are members of large groups no longer slows synchronisation to a crawl. Updating or deleting a large group's pending changes no longer reloads the group's full membership from the database each time.
- ⚡ Deleting Metaverse Objects during synchronisation (0-grace-period deprovisioning) is now set-based instead of object-by-object. Each page of deletions previously cost around 75 sequential database round trips per object (per-object lookups, per-attribute change record inserts, and an unindexed audit-history update); a leaver-cohort page flush that took around 50 seconds now completes in a small, fixed number of bulk operations, and a new index covers the audit-history detach that previously scanned the whole Activities table once per deleted object.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- ✨ Synchronisation Rules can now carry an optional description recording what the rule is for. Set it in the admin portal, with `New-JIMSyncRule`/`Set-JIMSyncRule`, or the REST API; changes appear in the change history.
- ✨ Date/time scope filters and object searches can now be relative to "now" (a count, a unit from Hours to Years, and a direction, for example "30 to 364 days ago") rather than a fixed date, re-evaluating every run so the scope keeps moving with time.
- ✨ Relative-date scopes keep working when source data isn't changing: a new built-in hourly Temporal Scope Reconciliation schedule re-evaluates time-driven transitions, so leavers deprovision and joiners provision as their dates pass. It can be re-timed or disabled, not deleted.
- ✨ Predefined Searches can now filter on any attribute type (Number, Long Number, Date/Time, Boolean and GUID) with type-appropriate operators and case-sensitive or -insensitive text matching. Manage criteria from a new editor, the PowerShell module, or the REST API.
- ✨ Predefined Search criteria can now be combined with AND/OR logic and nested groups, for example "(Department is Finance or Sales) and active", rather than a flat list.
- ✨ Example data templates can now build a text attribute from an expression, using the same `mv["Attribute Name"]` syntax and functions as Attribute Flows, so a generated value can derive from other attributes on the same object. Circular references are detected up front.
- ✨ The Activity list is easier to audit: category (Configuration, Identity, Synchronisation, System), initiator (user, API key, system) and created-date filters narrow the view, and the filter state is reflected in the URL so a view can be bookmarked or shared.
- ✨ An API Key's Name and Description can now be edited directly from its Details tab in the admin portal, without PowerShell or the REST API.

#### Attribute Priority (#91)

- ✨ When more than one Connected System contributes a Metaverse attribute, a configurable per-attribute priority order now picks the winner, so a higher-priority source is never overwritten by a lower one; a "Null is a value" option lets an authoritative source assert "no value".
- ✨ Attribute Priority is manageable in the admin portal: a Metaverse Object Type's Attributes tab shows each attribute's contributor count, and expanding a multi-contributor one lets you drag its Synchronisation Rules into priority order and toggle "Null is a value".
- ✨ The REST API and `Get-JIMMetaverseObject` now show each attribute value's provenance: the Connected System and Synchronisation Rule that won priority resolution. Asserted nulls appear as flagged, value-less rows, distinguishing a deliberate blank from one with no contributor.
- ✨ Synchronisation Activities now report when an attribute became blank with nothing to replace it, as a distinct "MVO No Contributor" outcome alongside "MVO Null Asserted", so you can tell a deliberate clear from every source falling away.

#### Configuration Change History (#14)

- ✨ JIM now tracks a versioned history of who changed what and when across its configuration: Synchronisation Rules, Connected Systems, Schedules, Service Settings, Metaverse schema, and more. Retrieve it in the portal, via `Get-JIMConfigurationChangeHistory`, or the REST API.
- ✨ Secrets are never captured in the change history: encrypted setting values, a Schedule step's SQL connection string, certificate material, and API key secrets are all flagged as changed but never stored, not even as a hash.
- ✨ You can record a reason for any configuration change: `-ChangeReason` on the write cmdlets or an optional REST field, plus a "Reason for change" prompt when saving in the admin portal. The reason shows with the change and on its Activity.
- ✨ Deleting a Connected System records a final snapshot of its configuration, so a decommissioned system's last-known state and who removed it stay auditable; the captured state is shown on the delete Activity as a clearly-marked removal.
- ✨ Configuration change history is retained on its own schedule: a new Configuration change retention period Service Setting (default ~10 years) governs it, separate from general history retention.
- ✨ First-time seeding of built-in configuration now appears as a single System Initialisation Activity with the seeded objects as children, so a new deployment starts with one clear entry instead of a page of system rows.
- 🔄 A factory reset now preserves the change-history provenance of the built-in objects it keeps, re-recording their version-1 baselines under a fresh System Initialisation Activity instead of stripping their factory origin from the audit trail.
- 🔄 Data-generation runs are now a distinct "Data Generation" activity type, separated from Example Data Template configuration changes, so the Activities Configuration filter isn't cluttered by generation runs. Existing runs are reclassified on upgrade.

#### API & PowerShell Coverage (#154)

- ✨ Connected System Objects can now be listed and filtered via a paginated REST endpoint and the extended `Get-JIMConnectedSystemObject` cmdlet, rather than looked up one at a time.
- ✨ Example Data Sets now support full create, update, and delete via the REST API and the new `New-`, `Set-`, and `Remove-JIMExampleDataSet` cmdlets, alongside the existing read access.
- ✨ Queued and in-progress background operations can now be listed, inspected, and cancelled remotely via a new Worker Tasks REST endpoint and the `Get-JIMWorkerTask` / `Stop-JIMWorkerTask` cmdlets.
- ✨ File system browsing, log viewing, and Metaverse Attribute priority management (previously UI-only) are now available as PowerShell cmdlets, giving the module full parity with the REST API.
- ✨ A single Connected System Object Type can now be retrieved by id from the REST API, returning the object type with its attributes, to match the existing update endpoint.

#### PowerShell Log Streaming (#466)

- ✨ Service logs can now be streamed live from PowerShell with the new `Watch-JIMLog` cmdlet: it polls the Logs API, shows only new entries, supports the same filters as `Get-JIMLogEntry`, and keeps polling through transient failures until you stop it with Ctrl+C.

### Changed

- 🔄 **Breaking (REST API and PowerShell):** the object type in Metaverse Object list responses is now a nested `type` object (`{ id, name }`), matching the single-object response, instead of the flat `typeId`/`typeName` properties. This affects `GET /api/v1/metaverse/objects`, the Pending Deletions list (`GET /api/v1/metaverse/pending-deletions`), and Role members (`GET /api/v1/security/roles/{id}/members`), plus the `Get-JIMMetaverseObject`, `Get-JIMPendingDeletion`, and `Get-JIMRoleMember` cmdlets that wrap them. Callers reading `.typeId`/`.typeName` on list results must switch to `.type.id`/`.type.name`. The attribute representation is deliberately left as-is (a name-to-string map on the list, typed value objects on the single object) because the shapes genuinely differ.
- 🔄 When more than one Connected System contributes to the same Metaverse attribute, JIM now resolves the value by attribute priority instead of by synchronisation timing (last-writer-wins). Single-source attributes are unaffected; existing multi-source attributes resolve deterministically until you set an explicit priority order.
- 🔄 When the source currently providing a multi-source attribute disconnects, JIM now hands the attribute to the next-priority Connected System still contributing it, rather than clearing the value. The attribute is only cleared when no other source contributes.
- 🔄 The Activity children REST endpoint (`GET /api/v1/activities/{id}/children`) and the `Get-JIMActivityChildren` cmdlet are now paged, so a parent with many child activities no longer returns them all in one response. The endpoint now returns a paged envelope instead of a bare array, and the cmdlet gains `-Page`, `-PageSize`, and `-All` (it still emits one object per child to the pipeline). `Get-JIMActivityChildren` is also now exported from the module, having previously been unreachable.
- 🔄 Attribute hand-over on source disconnection now also covers reference attributes (such as a manager) in the same synchronisation run, and correctly retains a value when the surviving source holds an identical copy; previously an identical value could be cleared until the surviving source next synchronised.
- 🔄 Attribute hand-over now also triggers when a still-connected source simply stops supplying a value: the next-priority contributor takes over in the same synchronisation run instead of the attribute staying blank until that contributor next synchronises.
- 🔄 Multi-source Metaverse attributes now resolve by attribute priority instead of synchronisation timing (last-writer-wins). Single-source attributes are unaffected; existing multi-source ones resolve deterministically until you set an explicit priority order.
- 🔄 When a source supplying a multi-source attribute disconnects, leaves scope, or stops providing the value, JIM now hands it to the next-priority contributor still supplying it (reference attributes included), clearing it only when none survives.
- 🔄 A deletion grace period no longer freezes attribute hand-over at scope exit: a re-elected attribute is still handed over, and only a single-source value with no surviving contributor is held for the grace window.
- 🔄 Activity displays no longer abbreviate "Synchronisation Rule" to "Sync Rule". The underlying `ActivityTargetType.SyncRule` enum value is renamed to `SynchronisationRule`, a breaking REST/OpenAPI change acceptable pre-v1.0.
- 🔄 The Activity children REST endpoint and `Get-JIMActivityChildren` are now paged, returning a paged envelope rather than every child at once; the cmdlet gains `-Page`, `-PageSize`, and `-All`, and is now exported from the module (previously unreachable).
- 🔄 A Connected System's Settings tab now groups its top-level setting categories into a collapsible accordion and separates second-level headings with a divider, making dense connector settings easier to scan.

### Performance

- ⚡ Synchronisation imports use far less memory: comparison no longer keeps every loaded object (plus a change-tracking snapshot) for the whole run, nor loads referenced objects in full just to compare group memberships; at 100,000 users with ~5,000 groups this had cost gigabytes.
- ⚡ The worker now returns memory to the operating system after each heavy operation completes, instead of holding its peak allocation while idle, and logs its garbage-collection configuration at startup.
- ⚡ Generating example data is dramatically faster: the built-in "Users & Groups" template (10,000 users) now completes in seconds rather than minutes, after moving blocking progress writes out of the parallel generation loop.
- ⚡ Example data value uniqueness is now tracked with constant-time lookups instead of rescanning an ever-growing list under a global lock, removing a cost that grew with the square of the object count at larger template sizes.

### Fixed

- 🐛 Adding a Trusted Certificate via the REST API or `Add-JIMCertificate` no longer returns a "No route matches" error on success (the certificate was stored regardless); `Get-JIMCertificate` on an empty store no longer emits the pagination envelope as a certificate.
- 🐛 Re-keying an identity in a source (so a new record re-matches an identity while the old one is removed) no longer fails a Full Synchronisation with a database constraint violation; two new records matching one identity fail cleanly on the second, not aborting the run.
- 🐛 A Full Synchronisation after a configuration change (attribute priority, enabling/disabling a rule, scoping) now applies it to every object; previously objects whose source data hadn't changed were skipped, so a pure configuration change never took effect for them.
- 🐛 A synchronisation run that both created a Metaverse Object and detected drift on it no longer fails with a database foreign-key violation; drift is now evaluated after new objects are saved, so the corrective export always references a real object.
- 🐛 A Full or Delta Synchronisation no longer aborts with a database concurrency error when updating a Metaverse Object created earlier in the same run, a race seen at scale; a page that fails to persist now reports which objects were affected instead of a generic error.
- 🐛 Deleting a Metaverse Object (for example a deprovisioned leaver) now stages membership-removal exports for every object that referenced it, so groups in target systems without referential integrity no longer keep the deleted user as a member forever.
- 🐛 Deleting a Connected System Object that other objects still reference no longer fails the whole run with a database foreign-key violation; the stale references are cleared as part of the deletion, with the raw strings preserved so the next confirming import reconciles.
- 🐛 A synchronisation run that fails while saving to the database no longer leaves its Activity stuck in progress; the failure is recorded via a fresh database session, since the failing one cannot save anything further.
- 🐛 A Connected System hierarchy refresh that returns no partitions no longer wipes the configured hierarchy: a transient connection or scope problem previously deleted every partition and container, including selected ones. JIM now leaves it untouched and records a warning.
- 🐛 A factory reset no longer strips the built-in "Users & Groups" example data template of its attributes (a side effect of the bulk wipe that left generated objects value-less); the template is now restored as part of the reset.
- 🐛 Editing an API Key or Trusted Certificate now records who made the change and when; previously the "last updated" attribution was silently lost on save.
- 🐛 Activity targets now deep-link to where their subject is managed: an Attribute Flow change to the rule's Attribute Flow tab, imports to the Connected System's Schema and Partitions tabs, and Schedule, Service Setting, and Metaverse activities to their pages.
- 🐛 The Schedules links on the home page now open the Schedules tab on the Operations page directly, instead of landing on the default Queue tab.
- 🐛 Save and create buttons across the admin portal now react as you type instead of waiting for the field to lose focus, and no longer start disabled when editing an existing item whose required fields are already filled in.
- 🐛 The Service Setting edit dialog no longer allows saving an unparseable duration into a time-period setting; the value is validated as you type and Save stays disabled until it is valid.
- 🐛 Updated the bundled Microsoft.OpenApi library to a patched release (2.7.5), clearing a high-severity advisory (GHSA-v5pm-xwqc-g5wc) in JIM's API documentation generation.
- 🐛 The `-ConnectedSystemAttributeName` parameter on `New-`/`Set-JIMScopingCriterion` now resolves the attribute correctly; it previously queried a non-existent endpoint, so scoping criteria specified by attribute name failed (the id-based parameter was unaffected).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- ✨ Inbound attribute mappings can now clean and normalise imported text per mapping: treat whitespace-only and empty values as no value (on by default, so a stray space no longer masquerades as a real value), trim and collapse whitespace, and normalise case (Upper, Lower or Title), configurable in the mapping editor, REST API, and PowerShell module. Switch it off per mapping where whitespace is meaningful, and the portal then flags such values with a "(whitespace)" indicator instead of rendering them blank.
- ✨ The PowerShell module now persists your interactive SSO sign-in across terminal sessions: after `Connect-JIM`, opening a new terminal reconnects silently without a browser. Only the refresh token is stored, in the operating system's credential store (Credential Manager on Windows, login Keychain on macOS, libsecret on Linux), with no extra password beyond your normal OS sign-in. Use `Connect-JIM -NoPersist` to opt out for a session, `-Force` to re-authenticate and overwrite the stored token, and `Disconnect-JIM` to remove the stored token for the current instance (`-Url` for a specific instance, `-All` for every instance). Headless Linux without a keyring falls back to in-memory tokens and points you to `-ApiKey`.
- ✨ Inbound text attribute mappings can now clean and normalise imported values per mapping: treat whitespace-only/empty as no value (default on), trim, collapse internal whitespace, and normalise case. Configurable in the mapping editor, REST API, and PowerShell module.
- ✨ The PowerShell module now persists your interactive SSO sign-in across terminal sessions: after `Connect-JIM`, new terminals reconnect silently, storing only the refresh token in the OS credential store. Use `-NoPersist`, `-Force`, and `Disconnect-JIM` to control it.
- ✨ Factory reset is now available in the portal: a new Administration danger area (`/admin/factory-reset`) with a backup warning, type-to-confirm, and an optional "delete administrators" path.
- ✨ The initial administrator can now be bootstrapped via the PowerShell module or REST API, not just the portal. Their first authenticated call just-in-time creates the identity and grants the Administrator role, so an air-gapped instance is fully CLI-administrable.

### Changed

- 🖥️ The Synchronisation Rule editor is now organised into deep-linkable tabs (Details, Matching, Scope, Attribute Flow, Danger Zone) instead of one long page, with a single save bar beneath every tab so the whole rule still saves in one action.
- 🖥️ The Connected System Schema tab is now split into sub-tabs: a searchable, filterable "Object Types" grid for choosing which types JIM manages, plus a tab per selected type for its attributes. This stays usable when a system exposes hundreds of object types.
- 🖥️ Connected System settings that only apply in certain configurations are now hidden until relevant and required once shown (for example, LDAP Certificate Validation appears only with LDAPS enabled), enforced in the form and for API callers.
- 🔄 The REST API now rejects an invalid Connected System settings update with HTTP 400 and a per-setting list of what failed and why, instead of silently saving it. `Set-JIMConnectedSystem` surfaces these field-level messages.
- 🔄 JIM now requests the `offline_access` scope at interactive sign-in so the identity provider issues a refresh token; this enables in-session token renewal and PowerShell token persistence. Existing SSO deployments must permit `offline_access` on the interactive client.
- 🔄 Factory reset now preserves administrator users by default (so you are not locked out) and records a Reset activity. Removing administrators too is opt-in via `-IncludeAdministrators` on `Reset-JIMSystem` (and `includeAdministrators` on the reset API).
- 🔄 The reconnection overlay now shows live attempt progress (for example, "Attempt 2 of 5...") while JIM re-establishes a dropped connection.
- 🔄 Running a PowerShell cmdlet before connecting now shows a clear one-line prompt to run `Connect-JIM -Url <your JIM URL>` instead of a raw internal error; it is non-terminating by default and can be made fatal with `-ErrorAction Stop`.
- 🔄 The "not authorised" message shown when an authenticated user has no JIM identity now explains that identities arrive via synchronisation or administrator provisioning, rather than directing them to sign in to the portal first.

### Fixed

- 🐛 Editing an existing Synchronisation Rule in the portal now saves. Changes such as disabling a rule appeared to succeed but were silently discarded; the editor now keeps a single database session and fails loudly rather than dropping the change.
- 🐛 Creating a Synchronisation Rule from scratch in the portal no longer fails (previously it raised a database foreign-key violation, so a new rule could not be saved at all), and the page now switches into edit mode once the rule is created.
- 🐛 The Synchronisation Rule expression tester now resolves attribute names case-insensitively, exactly as live synchronisation does, so an expression that works during a sync run no longer reports "no result" in the tester purely because an attribute name's casing differs.
- 🐛 A failed synchronisation expression is no longer silently swallowed, leaving stale metaverse data. The affected object is errored with a distinct "expression evaluation error" and its target left untouched, while the run continues (inbound and export mappings).
- 🐛 The File Connector now enforces "exactly one of Object Type Column or Object Type" at save time, with live form feedback and server-side validation, instead of failing later or silently ignoring a value. Connectors can declare such either/or setting groups generically.
- 🐛 Deleting a Connected System (including a synchronised one) no longer fails with a database error and is now atomic. Dependent objects are removed in the correct order, and metaverse values it contributed are kept with their contributor link cleared.

### Security

- 🔒 A factory reset now invalidates every existing portal sign-in session, so no stale access or privileges survive the wipe; users must re-authenticate. API key access is unaffected.
- 🔒 The REST API now rejects request bodies containing duplicate JSON property names, removing an ambiguous-parsing and request-smuggling vector.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- ✨ Create custom Metaverse Object Types via the API and the new `New-JIMMetaverseObjectType` cmdlet, to model identity types beyond Users and Groups.
- ✨ Scoping criteria now support long-integer and case-sensitive comparisons via the API and `New-JIMScopingCriterion`.
- ✨ Synchronisation Rules can now set their out-of-scope and deprovisioning actions and drift detection via the API and `Set-JIMSyncRule`.
- ✨ New factory reset (`Reset-JIMSystem` / `POST /api/v1/system/reset`) wipes all customer data and configuration in one transaction while preserving the schema, built-ins, and infrastructure access.

### Fixed

- 🐛 Refreshing a Connected System's schema now persists the discovered object types and attributes, so the selection interface appears immediately instead of reading back empty.
- 🐛 Outbound deprovisioning no longer fails with a duplicate-key error when the target object still has a Pending Export from a prior run.
- 🐛 Adding scoping criteria to an existing Synchronisation Rule via the API no longer fails to save.

### Changed

- 🔄 JIM is now distributed under the Tetron Software License Agreement v2.0.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- ✨ Metaverse Object change history is now available via the API and PowerShell module: new `GET /api/v1/metaverse/objects/{id}/change-history` endpoint returns paginated change records, and the new `Get-JIMMetaverseObjectChangeHistory` cmdlet wraps it for automation and compliance scenarios.
- ✨ Connected System Object change history is now available via the API and PowerShell module: new `GET /api/v1/synchronisation/connected-systems/{id}/connector-space/{csoId}/change-history` endpoint returns paginated change records, and the new `Get-JIMConnectedSystemObjectChangeHistory` cmdlet wraps it for automation and compliance scenarios.

### Performance

- ⚡ Metaverse Object detail pages load substantially faster on objects with long change histories: the page no longer materialises the entire change graph upfront, fetching only a count alongside the object and loading change rows on demand when the Changes tab is opened.
- ⚡ Connected System Object detail pages load substantially faster on objects with long import histories: the page no longer materialises the entire change graph upfront, fetching only a count alongside the object and loading change rows on demand when the Change History tab is opened.
- ⚡ Connector Space list pages load substantially faster: the per-page projection no longer materialises full pending-export graphs or attribute-value entities, returning only the scalar columns the table actually renders.

### Fixed

- 🐛 Export Run Profile Execution Items and their linked Connected System Object Change rows now persist with the correct `ConnectedSystemObjectId` foreign key, restoring causality navigation from Operations into the CSO detail page and preventing exported objects from being mis-labelled as "Deleted" on the activity item detail page (#683).
- 🐛 Pending-export reference values in the Causality Tree attribute change table now render the resolved identifier (e.g. group member DN) alongside a clickable link to the stub Connected System Object, instead of showing only a clock icon with no value.

### Changed

- 💄 The Activity Run Profile Execution Item detail page no longer duplicates the Connected System Object's external ID in the Execution Summary prose; the identifier is already shown as a chip directly below.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- ✨ Predefined Searches can now be retrieved individually via the API and PowerShell module: new `GET /api/v1/predefined-searches/{id}` and `GET /api/v1/predefined-searches/by-uri/{uri}` endpoints return the full search graph, and `Get-JIMPredefinedSearch -Id` / `-Uri` now resolve directly against the server instead of filtering the list client-side (#154)

### Fixed

- 🐛 The "Initiated By" link on Activity and Activity Run Profile Execution Item detail pages now points to the correct Metaverse Object URL, derived dynamically from the initiator's Metaverse Object Type plural name (`/t/{typePluralName}/v/{id}`) instead of a broken hardcoded `/identity/person/{id}` path.
- 🐛 Safari sign-in against the development stack at `http://localhost:5200` no longer fails with `Correlation failed`; OIDC correlation cookies are now configured appropriately for plain-HTTP localhost in Development while production HTTPS defaults remain untouched.
- 🐛 The bundled "Users & Groups" example data template now persists at production speed without stalling the worker or pressuring memory; generation has been rewritten to use PostgreSQL `COPY` binary import in bounded batches, mirroring the proven pattern used on the synchronisation hot path.
- 🐛 Filled alerts in the `navy-o6` themes now meet WCAG AA contrast: light-theme info/success/warning/error variants and dark-theme filled info no longer place dark text on saturated backgrounds, and links inside filled alerts pick up the on-colour text colour rather than clashing with the semantic background.

### Changed

- 💄 Example data generation now reports live, batch-level persistence progress with a rolling ETA on the Activity record and progress bar, so administrators can see exactly where a large generation run is up to.
- 💄 Compact row spacing on the Metaverse Object detail Table view now extends to multi-valued reference rows (e.g. group Owners, Static Members), keeping large memberships readable at a glance.
- 🖥️ Refreshed the JIM portal and documentation typography to IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono, with a Space Grotesk accent on docs hero surfaces and the portal sidebar wordmark, for sharper identifier disambiguation and a more polished, designed feel across the product.
- 🖥️ The production error page now renders in the JIM brand (broken-cog illustration, Plex / Space Grotesk fonts, navy-o6 palette), honours the user's saved dark-mode preference and `prefers-reduced-motion`, and runs without a Blazor circuit so it remains reachable when middleware throws.
- 🛠️ `jim-reset` now stops any natively-run JIM.Web/Worker/Scheduler processes before tearing down the Docker stack, preventing port collisions (e.g. host port 5200) when the Docker stack is restarted after a `jim-build-light` debug session.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- ✨ Interactive browser-based SSO for the JIM PowerShell module now works against identity providers that require a separate public client registration for desktop/CLI tools, including Keycloak. Two new optional environment variables let administrators advertise client-facing SSO configuration to interactive clients without affecting backend token validation: `JIM_SSO_PUBLIC_AUTHORITY` for deployments where the backend and clients reach the identity provider on different URLs (split-horizon reverse proxies, development containers), and `JIM_SSO_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID` for deployments where the PowerShell module's public OAuth client is a distinct registration from the web application's confidential client. Both variables are optional and fall back to `JIM_SSO_AUTHORITY` / `JIM_SSO_CLIENT_ID` respectively, so single-URL single-client production deployments are unaffected.

### Changed

- 💄 Refined sidebar navigation styling: selected and hover items now show a contrasting rounded "pill" background that is inset from the drawer edges, with the hover background a stronger shade than the selected background so it remains visible when hovering an already-selected item. Active and hover backgrounds are theme-driven (`--jim-nav-active-bg` / `--jim-nav-hover-bg`) and tuned per theme, with sensible derived fallbacks for any future theme that does not set them.
- 🖥️ A more polished sidebar experience: the signed-in user menu is now anchored to the bottom of the drawer for quick access regardless of how many sections are above it, and pinning or collapsing the drawer is now a single click on a dedicated chevron in the drawer header.

### Fixed

- 🐛 Interactive `Connect-JIM` against Keycloak deployments previously failed with `Invalid parameter: redirect_uri` because JIM advertised the confidential web client ID to the PowerShell module. Administrators can now register a separate public client (as the [SSO Setup Guide](https://docs.junctional.io/administration/sso-setup/) has always instructed) and advertise it to interactive clients via the new `JIM_SSO_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
- 🐛 `Get-JIMRole` and the `GET /api/v1/security/roles` endpoint now report the correct static member count for each role; previously the count was always zero because the underlying query did not load role memberships. The count is now aggregated directly in SQL, so even roles with very large memberships are returned cheaply.
- 🐛 `Get-JIMRole -Id` and `GET /api/v1/security/roles/{id}` now report the correct static member count when retrieving a single role.
- 🐛 `Get-JIMMetaverseObjectRole` and `GET /api/v1/security/metaverse-objects/{id}/roles` now report the correct static member count for each role a Metaverse Object belongs to.
- 🐛 `GET /api/v1/synchronisation/connected-systems/{id}` now reports the correct Connected System Object count; previously it always returned zero because the navigation property was not loaded. The count is now sourced from a dedicated count query, mirroring how `pendingExportCount` is already computed.

### Security

- 🔒 Patched `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection` to 10.0.7 to address CVE-2026-40372 (GHSA-9mv3-2cwr-p262, high-severity elevation of privilege / authentication cookie forgery in ASP.NET Core Data Protection). Also drops the now-redundant transitive override of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml`, which Data Protection 10.0.7 brings in at a patched version directly.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- ✨ Added a Service Name and Service ID so you can tell JIM instances apart at a glance. Set a friendly name per instance on the Service Settings page and see it under "JIM" in the sidebar, in the browser tab title, and in the footer. The Service ID is generated once per instance and never changes, useful for tooling, logs, and telemetry (#583)
- ✨ Predefined Searches can now be disabled and re-enabled without deleting them; disabled searches are hidden from the portal, the search API, and the sidebar navigation, while administrators can still manage them via the admin UI, the new `/api/v1/predefined-searches` endpoints, and the new `Get-JIMPredefinedSearch` / `Set-JIMPredefinedSearch` PowerShell cmdlets (#555)
- ✨ PowerShell cmdlets for System endpoints: `Get-JIMHealth` (with `-Ready` and `-Live` probes), `Get-JIMVersion`, `Get-JIMAuthConfig`, and `Get-JIMUserInfo`; health, version, and auth config cmdlets work without `Connect-JIM` via a `-Url` parameter (#468)
- ✨ Interactive API reference powered by Scalar, available at `/api/reference` in all environments including air-gapped deployments; OpenAPI document is pre-generated at build time for instant loading with zero runtime overhead
- ✨ Public API reference published to the JIM documentation site at [docs.junctional.io/api/reference/](https://docs.junctional.io/api/reference/); automatically updated on every release to match the published JIM version
- ✨ Clear Connected System activity now tracks and displays removal statistics, showing how many Pending Exports and Connected System Objects were removed (#74)
- ✨ New count endpoints for Metaverse Objects, connector space, and Pending Exports, with filtering by object type, partition, change type, and status; suitable for dashboards, SIEM integration, and capacity monitoring (#154)
- ✨ New user menu in the navigation drawer showing the signed-in user's avatar (with initials), display name and username, with pinning, dark mode and sign-out controls in a single polished popover (#49)
- ✨ Automated integration test metrics streaming to central tracking system with Grafana dashboards (#476)
- 🔒 API and PowerShell support for managing Role membership on Metaverse Objects, enabling administrators to appoint or remove additional admins without restarting the service (#467)
- ✨ New API endpoints for Role member management: list members, add member, remove member, get Role by ID, and list the Roles a Metaverse Object is a member of
- ✨ New PowerShell cmdlets `Get-JIMRoleMember`, `Add-JIMRoleMember`, `Remove-JIMRoleMember`, and `Get-JIMMetaverseObjectRole` with full pipeline support
- ✨ `Get-JIMRole` cmdlet now supports `-Id` parameter for direct Role lookup by identifier
- 🔒 Safety checks prevent administrator lockout: self-removal from the Administrator role and removing the last Administrator are both blocked with clear error messages
- 🔒 Sign-out with identity provider, gated by the `SSOEnableLogOut` service setting, with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental clicks (#49)

### Performance

- ⚡ Connected System detail lookups are much cheaper on write-path and validation API calls: introduced a lightweight `GetConnectedSystemCoreAsync` retrieval variant that loads only essential properties, and migrated the API controllers that previously paid for the full schema, partition and container graph just to verify the system exists (#494)
- ⚡ Connected System container hierarchy loading now handles arbitrary depth and avoids the cartesian-explosion risk of the previous 11-level hard-coded Include chain; containers are loaded flat and rebuilt into a tree in memory (#494)
- ⚡ Full Connected System loads now issue one database query for Object Matching Rules instead of four, eliminating the fan-out that split-query mode introduced when walking `Sources.ConnectedSystemAttribute`, `Sources.MetaverseAttribute`, `TargetMetaverseAttribute` and `MetaverseObjectType` as separate Include branches (#494)
- ⚡ Default all EF Core queries to `AsNoTracking`, reducing memory and CPU overhead for read-heavy operations; write paths explicitly opt in to change tracking (#484)
- ⚡ Enriched diagnostic spans with cumulative object count and wall-clock offset tags for throughput profiling (#476)
- ⚡ Added MetricsCheckpoint log lines for guaranteed throughput tracking at any log level (#476)

### Changed

- 🖥️ Partition-configuration validation errors now pinpoint the exact gap (hierarchy not imported, no partitions selected, or selected partitions have no container selected) and name the partition involved, replacing the previous generic "no partitions or containers have been selected" message and making misconfigurations far faster to diagnose (#564)
- 🖥️ Page footer now links the Tetron name to tetron.io and includes a GitHub link next to the version number (#49)
- 📦 File Connector storage uses the formal Docker named volume `jim-connector-files-volume`, mounted at `/connector-files` inside JIM Web and JIM Worker. Default deployments get working File Connector exports out of the box without any host-side permission setup. Customers integrating with external file shares bind-mount over a subdirectory of `/connector-files`. See the JIM File Connector documentation for both patterns.

### Fixed

- 🐛 Group and other multi-valued-reference sync activities no longer produce duplicate execution items; cross-page reference resolution now merges reference Attribute Flow into the original Projected/Joined record instead of creating a second standalone "Attribute Flow" record for the same object. Fixes inflated activity counts and removes the confusing split-outcome rows that appeared in activity detail
- 🐛 Static member values and other multi-valued references on group activity detail pages now render as clickable user chips with display names instead of raw GUIDs; reference change records now carry their target as a proper foreign key so the link can be materialised on display
- 🐛 Export failures caught by exception handlers now produce Run Profile Execution Items reliably; previously a thrown connector exception could mark a batch failed without producing any RPEI, so the activity appeared to complete successfully despite silent export failures
- 🐛 Metaverse Object and Connected System Object change history is now persisted during sync RPEI flush and on single-object create, ensuring the audit timeline reflects every sync run
- 🐛 Sign-out with the bundled Keycloak no longer fails with "Missing parameters: id_token_hint"; JIM now persists the ID token during sign-in so the OIDC middleware can include it on the end-session request per the OIDC spec (#49)
- 🐛 Keycloak hostname configuration corrected so that browsers and Docker back-channel clients each get the right endpoint URLs, fixing sign-in and sign-out for all four deployment scenarios (Codespaces, devcontainer native, devcontainer Docker, production) (#49)
- 🐛 Connected System partition trees now include nested containers below the top level. Directories with nested organisational units (e.g. `OU=Users,OU=Corp`) are loaded and returned through the API in full, so administrators can select nested containers for import and automation can address them via PowerShell (#586)

### Security

- 🔒 Supply chain hardening: all Docker base images are digest-pinned, all GitHub Actions are pinned by commit SHA, and the main branch is protected with required status checks including automated code review, CodeQL, container scan, and dependency scan (#520, #517, #521)
- 🔒 Patched transitive `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` to 10.0.6 to address CVE-2026-33116 (low-severity DoS in `EncryptedXml`); the package is pulled in via ASP.NET Core Data Protection but not used by JIM at runtime
- 🔒 Patched `basic-ftp` CRLF injection vulnerabilities (GHSA-chqc-8p9q-pq6q and GHSA-rp42-5vxx-qpwr) and picked up Ubuntu Noble security updates for libldap and cifs-utils in all production container images

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-08

### Added

#### Search Objects API (#482, #488)

- ✨ New `GET /api/v1/metaverse/objects/search/{predefinedSearchUri}` endpoint for fast, lightweight object searches optimised for 100K+ object deployments
- ✨ New `Search-JIMMetaverseObject` PowerShell cmdlet with predefined search support, sorting, filtering, and auto-pagination

### Performance

#### Paginated List Optimisation (#482, #485)

- ⚡ Metaverse Object list sorting now uses a pre-computed cached display name column, eliminating expensive per-query subqueries for display name resolution
- ⚡ New composite index on metaverse attribute values for faster attribute-based sorting and filtering
- ⚡ Paginated list queries for Metaverse Objects and Connected System Objects rewritten to use keyset pagination with optimised sort subqueries

### Fixed

- 🖥️ Fixed oversized text on avatar chips in Synchronisation Rule list and detail pages
- 🖥️ Multi-valued attribute value counts on Metaverse Object detail pages now display with thousand separators for readability

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

#### 100K Object Scale (#451, #437, #438)

JIM now supports deployments of 100,000+ objects, validated by Scale100K integration tests across the full import, sync, and export pipeline. A bounded memory architecture ensures stable, predictable resource usage regardless of dataset size.

- ✨ Bounded memory sync and export pipelines: change tracker cleared at every page boundary and caches loaded per-page instead of upfront, enabling 100K+ object operations without out-of-memory crashes
- ✨ Partition-scoped deletion detection for full imports: deletion detection is now scoped to the imported partition, preventing CSOs from other partitions being incorrectly marked as obsolete during large-scale imports
- 🖥️ Import processing now displays throughput (objects/sec) and ETA in progress messages, completing progress tracking coverage across all long-running phases

#### .NET 10 Migration (#174)

- ✨ Migrated from .NET 9.0 (STS) to .NET 10.0 (LTS), extending support from November 2026 to November 2028
- ✨ Upgraded all NuGet packages to .NET 10-compatible versions, including EF Core 10, MudBlazor 9, and Humanizer 3
- ✨ Replaced Swashbuckle with built-in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` + Scalar for modern API documentation UI
- 🔒 All Docker containers now run as non-root (`USER app`, UID 1654), improving security posture for enterprise deployments
- 🔒 Docker container hardening (#333): read-only root filesystem, dropped all Linux capabilities with selective re-add, and `no-new-privileges` flag on all application containers
- 🔒 Moved CIFS/SMB utilities and capabilities from Web to Worker container, applying least-privilege principle (only the Worker executes file connector operations)
- 📦 Docker images migrated from Debian Bookworm to Ubuntu 24.04 Noble base with pinned SHA256 digests
- 📦 Added `global.json` to pin .NET 10 SDK version across all environments

#### Service Settings REST API & PowerShell Cmdlets

- ✨ New REST API for managing service settings (`GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/service-settings`), enabling automation of change tracking, sync page size, history retention, and other operational settings
- ✨ New PowerShell cmdlets: `Get-JIMServiceSetting`, `Set-JIMServiceSetting`, `Reset-JIMServiceSetting` for managing service settings from the command line or automation scripts

#### Data Integrity Validation (#465)

- 🔒 Metaverse attribute operations now validate data integrity before executing: deleting attributes with stored values, deleting attributes referenced by Synchronisation Rules, and removing object type mappings with existing data all return structured validation errors instead of silently corrupting state

#### PowerShell Module Enhancements

- ✨ `-Name` parameter added to six `Get-JIM*` cmdlets (`Get-JIMRunProfile`, `Get-JIMSyncRule`, `Get-JIMApiKey`, `Get-JIMCertificate`, `Get-JIMRole`, `Get-JIMConnectorDefinition`), enabling direct filtering without `Where-Object`
- ✨ New `Get-JIMPendingDeletion` cmdlet with List, Count, and Summary parameter sets for monitoring objects awaiting deletion
- ✨ New `Get-JIMActivityChildren` cmdlet for retrieving child activities of a parent activity

#### Integration Test Runner Enhancements

- ✨ `-LogLevel` parameter for integration test runner: override log verbosity (Verbose/Debug/Information/Warning/Error/Fatal) for the test run without permanently modifying `.env`
- ✨ `-DisableChangeTracking` switch for integration test runner: disable CSO and MVO change tracking during large-scale tests to reduce database writes and improve throughput
- 🖥️ Interactive menus for log level and change tracking selection when running tests without explicit parameters

### Fixed

- 🔒 Safe cancellation for sync operations (#339): when an admin cancels a running Full Sync or Delta Sync, the current page's flush pipeline now completes before exiting. Previously, cancellation could leave orphaned Metaverse Objects without corresponding Pending Exports, causing target systems to silently miss updates.
- 🐛 Fixed import tasks continuing to process after cancellation (#339); cancelling a Full Import or Delta Import from the Operations Queue now stops the import between pages and skips persistence. Previously, the import processor ignored the cancellation signal and ran to completion.
- 🐛 Fixed cancelled tasks having their status overwritten to Completed or Failed; the Worker now correctly preserves the Cancelled activity status instead of overwriting it when the processor finishes.
- 🐛 Fixed sync progress bar showing inflated object counts (CSOs + Pending Exports) instead of just CSOs; progress percentage and ETA are now accurate for Full Sync and Delta Sync

### Changed

- ⚡ LDAP export concurrency is now auto-tuned based on the detected directory server type; AD DS and OpenLDAP default to 16 concurrent operations (up from 4), while Samba AD and unknown directories remain at 4 for compatibility. Administrators who have manually configured the value will not be affected.

### Performance

- ⚡ Selective attribute loading for full sync: unchanged CSOs (based on watermark comparison) skip attribute value loading and Attribute Flow entirely, dramatically reducing I/O for large-scale repeat syncs
- ⚡ Eliminated redundant per-page COUNT queries during sync; total count is now passed from sync start, removing 200+ unnecessary full-table scans at 100K objects
- ⚡ Default sync page size increased from 500 to 1,000, halving the number of database round-trips per sync run
- ⚡ Sync progress updates now use direct SQL instead of EF Core change tracker, reducing per-page overhead
- ⚡ Removed explicit RepeatableRead transactions from sync page loading; PostgreSQL MVCC provides sufficient consistency without the round-trip overhead
- ⚡ Pending Exports table on CSO detail page now uses server-side paging; pages with thousands of pending changes (e.g. 10K member adds) load instantly instead of rendering all rows at once
- ⚡ All export evaluation and Pending Export cache queries now use `AsNoTracking`, eliminating unnecessary entity tracking overhead during sync
- ⚡ Per-page memory diagnostics logging: administrators can monitor memory usage across sync pages to verify bounded memory behaviour

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- ✨ Pre-export CREATE→DELETE reconciliation — when an object is created and then deleted before export runs, the redundant Pending Exports are automatically cancelled instead of failing during export (#218)

### Performance

- ⚡ Export rule evaluation optimised to reduce per-MVO processing cost, improving sync performance for configurations with many export rules (#417)
- ⚡ Active Directory schema discovery now batches LDAP queries, reducing connection round-trips during schema import (#433)

### Fixed

- 🐛 Fixed entity tracking conflict during cross-page reference resolution at scale — Full Sync no longer fails with "ConnectedSystemObject cannot be tracked" when groups share members across resolution batches (10,000+ users)
- 🐛 Error messages no longer display the internal "EMERGENCY UPDATE" prefix — user-facing messages now show clean, actionable text (#448)
- 🐛 Activity and RPEI detail page breadcrumbs are now context-aware, showing the correct navigation path based on how the page was reached
- 🔒 Sanitised `Request.Method` in global exception handler logging to prevent log injection (CWE-117) (#444)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

#### OpenLDAP Connector Support (#72)

- ✨ Full OpenLDAP and RFC 4512-compliant LDAP directory support — connect to OpenLDAP, 389 Directory Server, and other standards-based LDAP directories alongside Active Directory
- ✨ Automatic directory type detection from rootDSE (Active Directory, OpenLDAP, Generic LDAP) with per-type external ID handling (objectGUID vs entryUUID)
- ✨ RFC 4512 schema discovery — object classes and attribute types parsed from the subschemaSubentry with OID-based data type mapping and superclass hierarchy walking
- ✨ Multi-suffix partition discovery via rootDSE namingContexts for non-AD directories
- ✨ Accesslog-based delta import for OpenLDAP — queries `cn=accesslog` for incremental changes with automatic fallback to full import
- ✨ Parallel import with configurable concurrency — each container/objectType combination runs on its own LDAP connection, working around RFC 2696 paging cookie limitations
- ✨ Transparent `groupOfNames` placeholder member handling — automatically manages the RFC 4519 MUST constraint so administrators never see placeholder entries in the metaverse
- ✨ DN-aware RDN attribute detection for correct export naming
- ✨ Partition-scoped imports — Run Profiles can target a specific partition instead of importing all selected partitions (#353)

#### Worker Redesign (#394)

- ✨ Pure domain engine (`ISyncEngine`) — 7 stateless methods with zero I/O dependencies, making core sync logic independently testable with plain objects
- ✨ Formal data access boundary (`ISyncRepository`) — ~80-method interface separating Worker data access from shared EF Core repositories, with purpose-built in-memory implementation for tests
- ✨ Dependency injection throughout Worker and Scheduler — `IJimApplicationFactory`, `IConnectorFactory`, per-task context isolation

#### Bundled Keycloak IdP for Development (#197)

- ✨ Zero-config SSO — `jim-stack` starts a pre-configured Keycloak instance alongside JIM; developers sign in immediately with `admin` / `admin`
- ✨ Pre-configured realm with `jim-web` (confidential + PKCE) and `jim-powershell` (public + PKCE) clients, `jim-api` scope, and two test users
- ✨ `.env.example` defaults point to the bundled Keycloak — no manual IdP configuration needed for local development
- ✨ `jim-keycloak` / `jim-keycloak-stop` / `jim-keycloak-logs` aliases for standalone Keycloak (F5 debugging workflow)
- ✨ Keycloak admin console accessible at `http://localhost:8181`
- 🔒 HTTP OIDC authority support for development (RequireHttpsMetadata conditionally disabled)

#### Object Type Icons (#92)

- 🖥️ Configurable icons for Metaverse Object Types — assign icons to object types, displayed across the homepage, navigation menu, schema pages, and object detail views

#### Pending Export Management

- 🖥️ Pending Export detail page with grouped attribute changes, capped multi-valued attribute loading, and server-side paginated drill-down for large change sets
- 🖥️ `Get-JIMPendingExport` and `Get-JIMConnectedSystemObject` PowerShell cmdlets with corresponding API endpoints
- 🖥️ Pending Exports list now shows display names instead of raw GUIDs

#### Activity Monitoring

- 🖥️ Auto-refresh polling on the activity list page — data updates automatically without manual refresh
- 🖥️ Pause/resume toggle for auto-refresh polling
- 🖥️ Compact determinate progress bar on the History tab for in-progress activities
- 🖥️ Phase-specific activity messages during imports — "Connecting to Connected System" and "Importing objects from Connected System" show the current phase before object processing begins (#342)

#### Run Profile Editing

- 🖥️ Run Profile editing UI — edit name, file path, partition, and page size for existing Run Profiles
- ✨ `SupportsFilePaths` connector capability — File Path fields only appear for connectors that use file-based import/export
- ✨ `SupportsPaging` connector capability — Page Size controls only appear for connectors that support paged queries

#### Navigation and Layout

- 🖥️ Browser back/forward navigation support for all tabbed pages via URL query parameters
- 🖥️ Tabs view mode for Metaverse Object details — attribute categories displayed as horizontal tabs alongside existing form and table views
- 🖥️ Expanded Target section in the Operations sidebar with type-specific links
- 🖥️ Connector capabilities grouped by category on the detail page

#### Infrastructure

- 📦 Docker healthchecks for Worker and Scheduler — file-based heartbeat monitoring detects stalled service loops (#185)
- ✨ Multi-valued to single-valued import Attribute Flow — when a multi-valued source Attribute Flows to a single-valued target, JIM automatically selects the first value and records a warning (#435)

### Performance

#### Worker Redesign (#394)

- ⚡ Parallel multi-connection writes — `ParallelBatchWriter` splits bulk database writes across N concurrent PostgreSQL connections, utilising multiple CPU cores during save phases. Configurable via `JIM_WRITE_PARALLELISM` environment variable
- ⚡ COPY binary protocol for bulk inserts — CSO creates, RPEIs, MVO creates, and sync outcomes now use PostgreSQL's COPY binary import, eliminating SQL parsing overhead and parameter limits (#338)
- ⚡ Worker-exclusive bulk SQL in `SyncRepository` — hot-path operations (RPEI persistence, CSO bulk create, Pending Export operations) moved from shared repositories into dedicated partial classes, reducing shared repo surface by 1,200+ lines

#### Import Pipeline (#427, #440)

- ⚡ Import CSO matching now uses a pre-fetched dictionary for O(1) external ID lookups, replacing N per-object database queries with a single bulk query at import start — eliminates the dominant bottleneck in full imports (#440)
- ⚡ Import reference resolution is now case-insensitive (matching RFC 4514 DN semantics) and batches sort non-referencing objects first with committed ID tracking — eliminates the expensive post-import LOWER() fixup SQL query (#427)
- ⚡ Two-phase parallel write commits CSO rows before attribute values, giving cross-partition references full FK visibility and eliminating post-import fixup queries (#427)

#### Sync and Export

- ⚡ Immediate MVO deletion (zero grace period) skips unnecessary attribute recall and export evaluation, eliminating wasted database round-trips (#390)
- ⚡ Deferred export resolution progress reporting throttled to every 50 items instead of per-item, eliminating ~540 unnecessary database round-trips for typical batches (#426)
- ⚡ Bulk RPEI and CSO change persistence timeouts increased to 300 seconds for large imports (#426)
- ⚡ Log file rolling size reduced from 500 MB to 50 MB per file (100 files retained, ~5 GB max per service)

### Fixed

- 🔒 Attribute change history is no longer cascade-deleted when a metaverse or Connected System attribute definition is removed — the FK is set to null and snapshot `AttributeName`/`AttributeType` properties preserve the audit trail indefinitely (#58)
- 🐛 Expression attribute lookups (e.g. `mv["Department"]`) are now case-insensitive, preventing silent failures when attribute name casing in expressions did not exactly match stored names (#341)
- 🐛 Pending Export reconciliation now correctly matches all 8 attribute data types — Boolean, Guid, and LongNumber exports previously failed to reconcile and appeared permanently stuck (#263)
- 🐛 Deferred export progress bar no longer shows values exceeding 100%
- 🐛 Progress bars on the History tab now update in real-time instead of freezing after initial page load
- 🐛 Worker database operations no longer time out during large imports — command timeout increased from 30s default to 300s (#426)
- 🐛 Connector-level warnings (e.g. delta import fallback) now appear as activity banners instead of phantom RPEIs with no CSO association
- 🐛 MVO reference attribute foreign keys are now reliably persisted across cross-page and cross-batch scenarios
- 🐛 MVO change tracking no longer crashes when recording deletion changes for objects with unloaded reference navigation properties

### Changed

#### Worker Redesign (#394)

- 🔄 All Worker and Workflow tests (~1,300) migrated from mocked `DbContext` to purpose-built `InMemoryData.SyncRepository`, eliminating three-way code path divergence between production, workflow tests, and unit tests
- 🔄 Removed ~32 try/catch EF fallback blocks from repository files (-642 lines) — production and test code paths are now identical

- 🔄 Object type names from camelCase LDAP schemas (e.g. `groupOfNames`) now display correctly as "Group Of Names"
- 🔄 Error type column merged inline with outcome chips on the activity detail page

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- 🎨 Sidebar background colour in the Navy O6 theme now matches the page background for a seamless, cohesive look

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- ✨ `GET /api/v1/userinfo` endpoint — returns the authenticated user's JIM identity, roles, and authorisation status without requiring Administrator privileges
- ✨ `Connect-JIM` now verifies authorisation after authentication and warns if the user has no JIM identity, with clear guidance to sign in via the web portal first
- 🖥️ Improved 403 error messages in the PowerShell module — now explains the likely cause (no JIM identity) and how to resolve it
- 🖥️ Properties tab on the Metaverse Object detail page — shows creation date, last modified, and clickable initiator links
- 🖥️ Form and table view toggle on the Metaverse Object detail page
- 🖥️ Server-side paginated dialog for large multi-valued attributes on the MVO detail page
- 🖥️ Object type chip prefix on reference values in MVO table view
- 🖥️ Server-side paging on the schema attributes table
- 🖥️ Sortable columns on the staging object attribute table
- ✨ Activity tracking for initial admin user creation
- 🔒 `Connect-JIM` now skips the authorisation check when using API key authentication

### Changed

- 🎨 New default theme with a refined colour palette — deeper backgrounds, improved button and chip contrast across dark and light modes, and better visual hierarchy for a more polished, readable experience
- 🎨 Switched web font to Inter — self-hosted for air-gapped deployment, delivering improved readability and a modern feel
- 🗑️ Removed legacy themes consolidated into the new default
- 🔄 "Connected System Objects" pages renamed to "Staging" with cleaner URL structure and improved introductory UX
- 🔄 "Data Generation" renamed to "Example Data" across the entire stack for consistent naming — models, API routes (`/example-data/`), PowerShell cmdlets (`Get-JIMExampleDataTemplate`, `Invoke-JIMExampleDataTemplate`), database tables, and UI all now share the "Example Data" family prefix
- ⚡ Database migrations flattened into a single `InitialCreate` migration for faster first-start performance and simpler codebase
- 🖥️ Redesigned object matching tab layout and combined status chips on the RPEI detail page

### Fixed

- 🐛 Resolved intermittent DbContext concurrency errors across all Blazor Server pages — overlapping async lifecycle methods (e.g. data load and table pagination) no longer share a single database context
- 🐛 FK violation in import change history bulk persistence no longer causes import failures
- 🐛 `HasPredefinedSearches` now returns the correct value for object types with predefined searches
- 🐛 Spurious Pending Exports no longer surface during full sync operations

#### Deleted Object Change History

- 🐛 Deleted MVO change history now shows the full timeline of prior changes (Created, AttributeFlow, Disconnected) — previously only the Deleted record was visible due to a broken FK correlation after deletion
- 🐛 Final attribute values are now captured on MVO deletion change records, showing exactly what the object looked like before it was removed
- 🐛 Final attribute values are now captured on CSO deletion change records — previously only the external ID and display name were preserved
- 🐛 MVO deletion no longer fails with FK constraint violations when the deleted object is referenced by other MVOs (e.g., as a Manager) or by change history records

#### Pending Export Reference Display (#404)

- 🐛 Pending Export reference attributes (e.g. group members) now display meaningful identifiers (DN, External ID) instead of raw GUIDs with a misleading "unresolved reference" warning
- 🐛 References to objects processed later on the same sync page are now resolved via a post-page resolution pass
- 🐛 Resolved reference attributes (e.g. group members) now appear in export causality tree attribute changes — previously they were silently dropped
- 🖥️ Pending Export references show a "Pending Export" indicator to distinguish them from fully resolved and genuinely unresolved references

#### Database Resilience (#408, #409)

- 🐛 Transient database errors now return HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) with a `Retry-After` header instead of HTTP 400 (Bad Request)
- 🐛 Cross-batch reference fixup hardened against database timeouts and FK gaps at scale
- ⚡ Transient database failures handled gracefully at API level with retry guidance
- ⚡ Connection pool sizing reduced from 50 to 30 per service to leave headroom within PostgreSQL's `max_connections`
- 📦 Development database (`db.yml`) now explicitly sets `max_connections=200` to match the full Docker stack

### Performance

- ⚡ MVO detail page now caps multi-valued attribute values with server-side pagination, dramatically reducing load time for objects with large MVAs
- ⚡ Pending Export reconciliation query optimised with sub-phase progress messages

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- ✨ Child activity tracking — sync activities now show nested child activities with drill-down navigation (#298)
- ✨ `Clear-JIMConnectedSystem` PowerShell cmdlet — wipe all objects from a Connected System without deleting the configuration (#365)
- 🛡️ Global error boundary catches unhandled rendering exceptions in the UI — instead of a broken page, users see a friendly error message with "Try Again" and "Go to Dashboard" recovery options (#167)
- 🖥️ "Has child activities" filter on the Activities list and Operations history pages
- 🖥️ Contextual page heading icons, refined operation/outcome chip colours, and improved causality tree display
- 🔒 Log injection sanitisation across all logging calls to prevent CWE-117 log forging
- 🔒 Trivy container image scanning added to CI pipeline

### Changed

- 🔄 Built-in "Employee Status" metaverse attribute replaced with the more generic "Status"

### Fixed

- 🐛 Cross-batch and cross-run reference resolution now correctly handles out-of-order LDAP imports and foreign key persistence
- 🐛 Cross-page reference RPEIs are now merged instead of creating duplicates
- 🐛 LDAP AddRequest now chunks large multi-valued attributes to avoid directory server size limits
- 🐛 Default `userAccountControl` to 512 on Create exports via Coalesce, preventing AD account creation failures
- 🐛 Parent activity progress messages no longer overwritten by child activities
- 🐛 Activity detail page correctly reloads when navigating between parent and child activities
- 🐛 Group member change history no longer shows "(identifier not recorded)" for members imported in a later batch — the DN string is now recorded when the referenced CSO hasn't been persisted yet at change history time

### Performance

- ⚡ Change history and RPEI persistence now uses PostgreSQL COPY binary import, dramatically reducing write time for large sync operations (#398)
- ⚡ Cross-batch reference fixup skipped entirely when no unresolved references exist (#398)
- ⚡ Partial database indexes added for cross-batch reference fixup queries (#397)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- ✨ Disconnection causality tracking — causality tree now traces MVO attribute changes and deletion fate during disconnection and recall, showing exactly what happened and why (#392)
- ✨ Reference attributes rendered as clickable links on RPEI detail page for easy navigation to related objects
- 🖥️ Filter controls on the Activities list page for quick searching by status, connector, and profile
- 🖥️ Initiated-by name now included in activity search results

### Fixed

- 🐛 Export activity detail page now shows display name for Create-type exports even after the target CSO is later deleted — display name is now snapshotted from the Pending Export's attribute changes at export time
- 🐛 Causality tree no longer shows a spurious attribute count chip on MVO Projected nodes when reference attributes were merged into the projection
- 🐛 Export runs no longer silently skip Pending Exports when a batch contains only deferred or ineligible items — all staged exports are now reliably processed in a single export run
- 🐛 Activity detail page now shows display name and object context for Create-type Pending Exports surfaced during sync (previously showed dashes as no CSO exists yet)
- 🐛 RPEI detail page now shows Pending Export attribute changes for staged (informational) Pending Exports, not only for error states
- 🐛 Causality tree no longer shows unrelated Pending Exports when a secondary import connector syncs while a previous connector's Create exports are still queued — only exports caused by the current sync's attribute changes are shown
- 🐛 Group membership exports no longer arrive empty — resolved reference foreign keys are now persisted during import
- 🐛 Resolved reference values now correctly persisted after export, preventing data loss on subsequent sync runs
- 🐛 Duplicate Pending Exports no longer accumulate — stale entries are automatically self-healed
- 🐛 Activities with unhandled errors now correctly marked as completed with error instead of appearing successful
- 🐛 Multi-valued attributes in LDAP group member exports are now consolidated into a single AddRequest, fixing partial membership writes
- 🐛 Export batch queries now include CSO object type, resolving objectClass errors in LDAP targets
- 🐛 Single-valued attribute duplicates no longer occur during Pending Export merges

### Performance

#### CSO Large MVA Pagination (#320)
- ⚡ CSO detail page and API now load capped MVA values (first 100) instead of the full collection, dramatically reducing memory and load time for objects with 10K+ multi-valued attributes
- ✨ New paginated attribute values API endpoint (`GET /api/connected-systems/{csId}/objects/{csoId}/attributes/{attributeName}/values`) with server-side search and pagination
- 🖥️ MVA dialog now fetches data on demand with server-side search and pagination — no longer holds the full value set in Blazor circuit memory
- ✨ API responses include per-attribute value summaries showing total count, returned count, and whether more values are available

#### Large-Scale Import Optimisation
- ⚡ Full import operations now handle 100K+ objects without out-of-memory failures through batch processing, raw SQL persistence, and incremental memory release
- ⚡ Export operations at scale now batch-load to eliminate EF change tracker overhead
- ⚡ Real-time batch progress reporting during large CSO persistence operations
