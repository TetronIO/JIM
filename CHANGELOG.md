## [Unreleased]

### Performance

#### CSO Large MVA Pagination (#320)
- ⚡ CSO detail page and API now load capped MVA values (first 100) instead of the full collection, dramatically reducing memory and load time for objects with 10K+ multi-valued attributes
- ✨ New paginated attribute values API endpoint (`GET /api/connected-systems/{csId}/objects/{csoId}/attributes/{attributeName}/values`) with server-side search and pagination
- 🖥️ MVA dialog now fetches data on demand with server-side search and pagination — no longer holds the full value set in Blazor circuit memory
- ✨ API responses include per-attribute value summaries showing total count, returned count, and whether more values are available

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- ✨ Self-contained object matching rules — sync rules now carry their own matching logic for import and export, enabling fully portable rule definitions (#386)
- ✨ CRUD API endpoints for sync rule object matching rules (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` `/api/v1/synchronisation/sync-rules/{id}/matching-rules`)
- ✨ Matching mode switching API — toggle between simple and advanced object matching per connected system
- 🖥️ Sortable Object Mapping and Capabilities columns on the Sync Rules page

### Fixed
- 🐛 Setup script now correctly detects Docker Desktop alongside Docker Engine

- 🖥️ Colour-coded outcome summary chips on Activity Detail rows for at-a-glance sync result visibility (#363)
- 🖥️ Filter activity results by outcome type — quickly find projections, joins, attribute flows, exports, and more (#363)

- 🔒 Hardened release pipeline with container scanning, SBOM attestation, and build validation
- 📦 Application blocks readiness until database migrations are applied

### Changed
- 🔄 Replaced "Change Type" filter with richer outcome type filtering on the Activity Detail page (#363)
