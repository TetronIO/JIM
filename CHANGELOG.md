# Changelog

All notable changes to JIM (Junctional Identity Manager) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Worker Redesign Option A (#394)

- ✨ Pure domain engine (`ISyncEngine`) — 7 stateless methods with zero I/O dependencies, making core sync logic independently testable with plain objects
- ✨ Formal data access boundary (`ISyncRepository`) — ~80-method interface separating Worker data access from shared EF Core repositories, with purpose-built in-memory implementation for tests
- ✨ Dependency injection throughout Worker and Scheduler — `IJimApplicationFactory`, `IConnectorFactory`, per-task context isolation

### Performance

#### Worker Redesign Option A (#394)

- ⚡ Parallel multi-connection writes — `ParallelBatchWriter` splits bulk database writes across N concurrent PostgreSQL connections, utilising multiple CPU cores during save phases. Configurable via `JIM_WRITE_PARALLELISM` environment variable
- ⚡ COPY binary protocol for bulk inserts — CSO creates, RPEIs, and sync outcomes now use PostgreSQL's COPY binary import, eliminating SQL parsing overhead and parameter limits
- ⚡ Worker-exclusive bulk SQL in `SyncRepository` — hot-path operations (RPEI persistence, CSO bulk create, pending export operations) moved from shared repositories into dedicated partial classes, reducing shared repo surface by 1,200+ lines

### Changed

#### Worker Redesign Option A (#394)

- 🔄 All Worker and Workflow tests (~1,300) migrated from mocked `DbContext` to purpose-built `InMemoryData.SyncRepository`, eliminating three-way code path divergence between production, workflow tests, and unit tests
- 🔄 Removed ~32 try/catch EF fallback blocks from repository files (-642 lines) — production and test code paths are now identical

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- 🎨 Sidebar background colour in the Navy O6 theme now matches the page background for a seamless, cohesive look

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- ✨ `GET /api/v1/userinfo` endpoint — returns the authenticated user's JIM identity, roles, and authorisation status without requiring Administrator privileges
- ✨ `Connect-JIM` now verifies authorisation after authentication and warns if the user has no JIM identity, with clear guidance to sign in via the web portal first
- 🖥️ Improved 403 error messages in the PowerShell module — now explains the likely cause (no JIM identity) and how to resolve it
- 🖥️ Properties tab on the Metaverse Object detail page — shows creation date, last modified, and clickable initiator links
- 🖥️ Form and table view toggle on the Metaverse Object detail page
- 🖥️ Server-side paginated dialog for large multi-valued attributes on the MVO detail page
- 🖥️ Object type chip prefix on reference values in MVO table view
- 🖥️ Server-side paging on the schema attributes table
- 🖥️ Sortable columns on the staging object attribute table
- ✨ Activity tracking for initial admin user creation
- 🔒 `Connect-JIM` now skips the authorisation check when using API key authentication

### Changed

- 🎨 New default theme with a refined colour palette — deeper backgrounds, improved button and chip contrast across dark and light modes, and better visual hierarchy for a more polished, readable experience
- 🎨 Switched web font to Inter — self-hosted for air-gapped deployment, delivering improved readability and a modern feel
- 🗑️ Removed legacy themes consolidated into the new default
- 🔄 "Connected System Objects" pages renamed to "Staging" with cleaner URL structure and improved introductory UX
- 🔄 "Data Generation" renamed to "Example Data" across the entire stack for consistent naming — models, API routes (`/example-data/`), PowerShell cmdlets (`Get-JIMExampleDataTemplate`, `Invoke-JIMExampleDataTemplate`), database tables, and UI all now share the "Example Data" family prefix
- ⚡ Database migrations flattened into a single `InitialCreate` migration for faster first-start performance and simpler codebase
- 🖥️ Redesigned object matching tab layout and combined status chips on the RPEI detail page

### Fixed

- 🐛 Resolved intermittent DbContext concurrency errors across all Blazor Server pages — overlapping async lifecycle methods (e.g. data load and table pagination) no longer share a single database context
- 🐛 FK violation in import change history bulk persistence no longer causes import failures
- 🐛 `HasPredefinedSearches` now returns the correct value for object types with predefined searches
- 🐛 Spurious pending exports no longer surface during full sync operations

#### Deleted Object Change History

- 🐛 Deleted MVO change history now shows the full timeline of prior changes (Created, AttributeFlow, Disconnected) — previously only the Deleted record was visible due to a broken FK correlation after deletion
- 🐛 Final attribute values are now captured on MVO deletion change records, showing exactly what the object looked like before it was removed
- 🐛 Final attribute values are now captured on CSO deletion change records — previously only the external ID and display name were preserved
- 🐛 MVO deletion no longer fails with FK constraint violations when the deleted object is referenced by other MVOs (e.g., as a Manager) or by change history records

#### Pending Export Reference Display (#404)

- 🐛 Pending export reference attributes (e.g. group members) now display meaningful identifiers (DN, External ID) instead of raw GUIDs with a misleading "unresolved reference" warning
- 🐛 References to objects processed later on the same sync page are now resolved via a post-page resolution pass
- 🐛 Resolved reference attributes (e.g. group members) now appear in export causality tree attribute changes — previously they were silently dropped
- 🖥️ Pending export references show a "pending export" indicator to distinguish them from fully resolved and genuinely unresolved references

#### Database Resilience (#408, #409)

- 🐛 Transient database errors now return HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) with a `Retry-After` header instead of HTTP 400 (Bad Request)
- 🐛 Cross-batch reference fixup hardened against database timeouts and FK gaps at scale
- ⚡ Transient database failures handled gracefully at API level with retry guidance
- ⚡ Connection pool sizing reduced from 50 to 30 per service to leave headroom within PostgreSQL's `max_connections`
- 📦 Development database (`db.yml`) now explicitly sets `max_connections=200` to match the full Docker stack

### Performance

- ⚡ MVO detail page now caps multi-valued attribute values with server-side pagination, dramatically reducing load time for objects with large MVAs
- ⚡ Pending export reconciliation query optimised with sub-phase progress messages

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added

### Fixed

- 🐛 Cross-batch and cross-run reference resolution now correctly handles out-of-order LDAP imports and foreign key persistence
- 🐛 Cross-page reference RPEIs are now merged instead of creating duplicates
- 🐛 LDAP AddRequest now chunks large multi-valued attributes to avoid directory server size limits
- 🐛 Default `userAccountControl` to 512 on Create exports via Coalesce, preventing AD account creation failures
- 🐛 Parent activity progress messages no longer overwritten by child activities
- 🐛 Activity detail page correctly reloads when navigating between parent and child activities
- 🐛 Group member change history no longer shows "(identifier not recorded)" for members imported in a later batch — the DN string is now recorded when the referenced CSO hasn't been persisted yet at change history time

### Performance

- ⚡ Change history and RPEI persistence now uses PostgreSQL COPY binary import, dramatically reducing write time for large sync operations (#398)
- ⚡ Cross-batch reference fixup skipped entirely when no unresolved references exist (#398)
- ⚡ Partial database indexes added for cross-batch reference fixup queries (#397)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-12

- ✨ Reference attributes rendered as clickable links on RPEI detail page for easy navigation to related objects
- 🖥️ Filter controls on the Activities list page for quick searching by status, connector, and profile
- 🖥️ Initiated-by name now included in activity search results

### Fixed

- 🐛 Export activity detail page now shows display name for Create-type exports even after the target CSO is later deleted — display name is now snapshotted from the pending export's attribute changes at export time
- 🐛 Causality tree no longer shows a spurious attribute count chip on MVO Projected nodes when reference attributes were merged into the projection
- 🐛 Export runs no longer silently skip pending exports when a batch contains only deferred or ineligible items — all staged exports are now reliably processed in a single export run
- 🐛 Activity detail page now shows display name and object context for Create-type pending exports surfaced during sync (previously showed dashes as no CSO exists yet)
- 🐛 RPEI detail page now shows pending export attribute changes for staged (informational) pending exports, not only for error states
- 🐛 Causality tree no longer shows unrelated pending exports when a secondary import connector syncs while a previous connector's Create exports are still queued — only exports caused by the current sync's attribute changes are shown
- 🐛 Group membership exports no longer arrive empty — resolved reference foreign keys are now persisted during import
- 🐛 Resolved reference values now correctly persisted after export, preventing data loss on subsequent sync runs
- 🐛 Duplicate pending exports no longer accumulate — stale entries are automatically self-healed
- 🐛 Activities with unhandled errors now correctly marked as completed with error instead of appearing successful
- 🐛 Multi-valued attributes in LDAP group member exports are now consolidated into a single AddRequest, fixing partial membership writes
- 🐛 Export batch queries now include CSO object type, resolving objectClass errors in LDAP targets
- 🐛 Single-valued attribute duplicates no longer occur during pending export merges

### Performance

#### CSO Large MVA Pagination (#320)
- ⚡ CSO detail page and API now load capped MVA values (first 100) instead of the full collection, dramatically reducing memory and load time for objects with 10K+ multi-valued attributes
- ✨ New paginated attribute values API endpoint (`GET /api/connected-systems/{csId}/objects/{csoId}/attributes/{attributeName}/values`) with server-side search and pagination
- 🖥️ MVA dialog now fetches data on demand with server-side search and pagination — no longer holds the full value set in Blazor circuit memory
- ✨ API responses include per-attribute value summaries showing total count, returned count, and whether more values are available

#### Large-Scale Import Optimisation
- ⚡ Full import operations now handle 100K+ objects without out-of-memory failures through batch processing, raw SQL persistence, and incremental memory release
- ⚡ Export operations at scale now batch-load to eliminate EF change tracker overhead
- ⚡ Real-time batch progress reporting during large CSO persistence operations
